# Digital-Human-Avatar ðŸ¤–âœ¨

# Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a Digital Human Avatar that autonomously presents a 1-2 minute text segment with high-quality AI-driven voice synthesis, lip-syncing, and animation. The avatar is designed to deliver natural, human-like presentations for various applications, such as virtual assistance, online training, or AI-driven storytelling.
